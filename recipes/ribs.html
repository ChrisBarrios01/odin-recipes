        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ribs are a southern staple that are easy to prep and forget the rest of the day while it cooks leaving you time to work on other tasks</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 to 2 ½ pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely diced onion</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon hot chili sauce like Sriracha</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>ground pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 275°F (135°C). Set aside a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet and foil.</li>
                <li>If your ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it. The tips section below explains how.</li>
                <li>Season both sides of the ribs generously with salt and pepper. If you are using a spice rub, rub it over the ribs.</li>
                <li>Place the ribs, meatiest-side up, in a large roasting pan. You may need to cut the ribs in half to fit them into the pan. Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil. Alternatively, wrap the rack in tight foil packets and place them on the baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake the ribs until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours. I check the ribs after 2 hours to see how they're doing. Ribs are ready to come out of the oven when the meat is cooked through and tender. To check, pierce them with a sharp knife. There should be little to no resistance. You can also gently bend the ribs. If the meat looks like it will easily pull away from the bone, they're ready.</li>
            </ol>
